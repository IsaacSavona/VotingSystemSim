# What is this and why was this made?

This is a simulation framework to run Monte Carlo simulations for different theoretical voting systems across the United States. This was made to put democractic voting systems, of the past and future, to the test (e.g., Condorcet or Ranked-Choice). The motivation for such thourough tests, comes down to a kernel of thoughts that the US voting system, as it inevtiably leads to an oversimplified two-party system which fundamentally lacks the nuance needed to communicate the needs of the people, should fundamentally change.

# How do you use this?

Well you can run this as long as you have `poetry` installed on your computer and the recquired Python dependencies. In the future, hopefully a TypeScript frontend will be implemented to allow people to interact with this on the web.
